PHASE 2

1) Absolutely! The data we see seems to be concurrent with the time and efficiency of every collection that was included with what we learned about in class.

2) There were a couple of outliers during the tests. One such time was a HashSet add time of 71685534.
This was roughly 20000000 nano seconds longer than the other HashSet adds. This could be caused by bad rng. The numbers may have just been inefficient
numbers for the HashSet to handle.

3) Individual{
add: top 3 - ArrayList, Vector. Hashmap
add: bottom 3 -Linked hash set, linled list, tree set
search top 3- hashset, linked hashset, treeset
search bottom 3- Treemap, hashmap, hashtable
remove top 3 -  treeset, hashtable, hashmap
remove bottom 3- Linked list, arraylist, vector
average top 3-
average bottom 3-
}
